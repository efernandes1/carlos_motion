# ToDo:
	* call Astar service to replan when robot gets stuck
	* control v=f(dist) for last target
	* change name from oea_controller to ?

# Issues:
	* gets stuck when is parallel to the goal. 

	
[SOLVED] Issues :
	* too much v (linear) on curves -> scale down if error_theta2 > 5 deg
	* not working when goal is behind the robot
	* program dies when robot arrives at the goal
	* in DE_ACCEL_LAST state: if robot gets stuck, can't recover nor stop. Gets stuck "forever".
	* always pub state -> pub controller_state for "obstacle", "lost"...
